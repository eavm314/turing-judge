# Turing Judge

**Turing Judge** is an interactive platform for designing, simulating, and evaluating Finite State Machines (FSM), Pushdown Automata (PDA), and Turing Machines (TM). It is designed as an educational tool to support students and educators in the exploration of computational models.

## ✨ Features

- Graphical editor for FSM, PDA, and TM
- Step-by-step visual execution of automata
- Import/export automata as JSON
- Virtual judge system for creating and solving exercises
- User authentication and saved automata

## 📚 Use Cases

- Computer Science education
- Automata theory labs
- Competency-based evaluation for formal languages
